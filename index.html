    <h1 class="title1">What is Fixed Piece?</h1>
    <p class="mobile-line-break">Fixed Piece is a Fan Project of cutting down all unwanted filler from the One Piece episodes. <br>We come from massive inspiration of the other fan project One Pace. However, we make sure <br>that filler is cut out unless it is filler that the fanbase actually wants included. We try to follow <br>the exact order of the panels in the manga but make sure the viewer experience is still perfect.</p>
    <h1 class="title2">Why should I use Fixed Piece?</h1>
    <p class="mobile-line-break">We strive to make sure the viewing experience is as entertaining and rewatchable as possible <br>by keeping in good filler and removing parts that make the series too bloated and a slog to get <br>through. All team members are caught up with the latest arcs and have read the manga, so they <br>know what parts to keep in and what to keep out. We also ask server members what they want <br>to be kept in so we know exactly what the community wants.</p>
