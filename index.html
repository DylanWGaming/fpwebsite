    <h1>What is Fixed Piece?</h1>
    <p>Fixed Piece is a Fan Project of cutting down all unwanted filler from the One Piece episodes.<br>We come from massive inspiration of the other fan project One Pace. However, we make sure<br>that filler is cut out unless it is filler that the fanbase actually wants included. We try to follow<br>the exact order of the panels in the manga but make sure the viewer experience is still perfect.</p>
    <h1>Why should I use Fixed Piece?</h1>
    <p>Fixed piece is a project that aims to remove padding from the original one piece anime, while<br>keeping good filler and sakuga sequences to create a more enjoyable experience. Please visit<br>our Discord server for more information.</p>
